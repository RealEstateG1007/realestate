Product Requirement Document (PRD)
Product Name: RealEstate Connect (Marketplace Platform)
Version: 1.0 (MVP)
Status: Draft

1. Executive Summary
Purpose: To eliminate the fragmentation in real estate transactions by creating a centralized digital ecosystem. The platform connects property buyers, sellers, and agents, facilitating seamless property discovery, secure communication, and streamlined deal management.

Vision: To become the most trusted and transparent digital infrastructure for real estate transactions, reducing the average time-to-close by 30% through automation and centralized data.

2. Problem Statement
Fragmentation: Listings are scattered across multiple portals (Craigslist, Zillow, local newspapers) and social media.

Opacity: Buyers struggle to verify property authenticity, and sellers lack insights into buyer credibility.

Inefficiency: Communication relies on phone calls, texts, and emails, leading to missed messages and disorganized deal tracking.

High Friction: Scheduling viewings and managing paperwork (offers, agreements) is manual and slow.

3. Goals & Objectives (OKRs)
User Acquisition: Onboard 500 properties and 2,000 active buyers within 6 months of launch.

Engagement: Achieve a 70% response rate to inquiries within 4 hours via in-app chat.

Conversion: Facilitate 50 successful deal initiations (offers submitted) in the first quarter.

Efficiency: Reduce the average steps from "Inquiry" to "Site Visit Scheduled" by 50%.

4. Target Audience (Personas)
The Home Buyer (Alex): A millennial professional looking for verified listings. Wants high-res photos, virtual tours, and instant communication with the seller/agent.

The Property Seller (Sarah): An individual homeowner or small landlord. Wants to showcase her property to serious buyers without spam calls.

The Real Estate Agent (Marcus): A professional managing multiple clients. Wants a CRM-like interface to track leads, manage showings, and store documents.

5. User Stories
As a Buyer, I want to filter properties by price, location, and amenities so that I only see relevant listings.

As a Buyer, I want to schedule a site visit directly through the platform so that I don't have to make phone calls.

As a Seller, I want to receive analytics on how many people viewed my property so that I can gauge interest.

As an Agent, I want to manage all my client communications in one thread per property so that I don't lose context.

As a User, I want to verify my identity so that other parties trust I am a serious participant.

want tech stack in this Node.js, Express.js,
AI / GenAI: Large Language Models (LLMs), Prompt Engineering,
Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL,
Other Tools: REST APIs, Authentication (JWT / OAuth).
We need to revise the tech stack recommendation in the PRD to match the user's specified technologies: Node.js, Express.js, AI/GenAI (LLMs, Prompt Engineering), Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL, Other Tools: REST APIs, Authentication (JWT/OAuth). Also need to incorporate AI/GenAI aspects into the product features, maybe as part of the platform (e.g., AI-powered property recommendations, chatbot, etc.). The user likely wants to see how AI can be used in the real estate marketplace. So we need to update the PRD to include AI features and adjust the tech stack section accordingly. Also note the user mentioned "MongoDB / PostgreSQL" – they might be open to either, but we should present both options and perhaps recommend PostgreSQL for relational data, but MongoDB could be used as well. We'll keep it flexible.

We'll modify the PRD to:

Add AI/GenAI features: e.g., AI-powered property recommendations, automated listing descriptions using LLMs, smart search with natural language, AI chatbot for buyer inquiries, etc.

Update the Technical Stack section to explicitly mention Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, JWT/OAuth, and both MongoDB and PostgreSQL as options.

Possibly include AI model integration: use of LLMs via APIs (OpenAI, etc.) or open-source models.

Ensure authentication is covered.

We should also reflect that the user wants "comprehensive prd for it" but with this tech stack. So we need to embed these specifics.

Let's restructure the PRD:

Keep the same sections but update Tech Stack and add AI features in Functional Requirements (maybe a new module for AI features). Also ensure the other tools are mentioned.

We'll produce a final answer with the updated PRD.

Here is the updated comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) incorporating your specified tech stack: Node.js, Express.js, AI/GenAI (LLMs, Prompt Engineering), MongoDB/PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and JWT/OAuth authentication.
