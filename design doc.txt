3. Layout & Structure (Hypothesized Based on Real Estate Norms & Text)

Header: Likely features the ARKO logo, main navigation (e.g., Home, Projects, Services, About, Contact), and a "Contact Us" call-to-action button.

Hero Section: A full-width, striking image or video of a signature property. Overlay text would feature the main tagline: "Innovative Architecture, Functional Design" and a prominent button like "Explore Our Work" or "Get a Consultation."

Introduction/"About" Section: A brief area summarizing the 7+ years of experience and the client-first philosophy. Could include a small, elegant mockup of a floor plan or blueprint.

Featured Projects/Portfolio: A grid or carousel showcasing high-quality images of completed residential projects.

Services Section: Clearly outlining "Tailored, turn-key building solutions." Icons or simple graphics would pair with each service.

Call-to-Action Section: A dedicated area inviting users to start a project, echoing the "Ready to create something amazing together? Contact Us Now!" message from the description.

Footer: Standard copyright, secondary links, and possibly social media links.

4. User Flow & Functionality (Key Actions)

Discover: User lands on the homepage, scrolls through the visual portfolio to understand the company's style.

Learn: User navigates to "About" or reads the intro text to understand the company's philosophy and experience.

Explore: User views detailed project pages (if applicable) to see specific examples of work.

Connect: User is compelled to click the "Contact Us" button, likely leading to a form or contact details to initiate a consultation.

5. Technical & Responsive Considerations

Platform: Likely a custom-built or template-based responsive website.

Performance: High-resolution images must be optimized for fast loading without sacrificing quality.

Mobile Experience: On mobile, the layout should stack vertically, with the navigation likely collapsing into a "hamburger" menu. Touch targets for buttons (like "Contact Us") must be large and easily tappable.
